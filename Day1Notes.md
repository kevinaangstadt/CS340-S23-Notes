"Half of software engineering is crap" - popular opinion

"70-90% of software engineering is crap" - Kevin

### **SE: The Good Bits**
- Practice relevant skills for jobs
- "Everything but programming
- How to use a computer
- How to collaborate on files
- How to gain confidence that your SW will work
- What do we do when it doesn't work?`
- How to plan a SW prokect

**Program** - collection of instructions on ordered operations for a computer to perform a specific function or task

**Software** - collection of programs, procedures, data, or instructions that work together to provide a specified functionality.

### **How does SW compare to programs we write in CS courses?**
| Similar | Different |
| --- | ----------- |
| Programming Languages | Public |
| Coding | Security |
| | Usability |
| | Quality Control |
| | Size |

### **What becomes necessary as codebases increase in size?**
- Documentation
    - of the code
    - user facing
- Design
- Testing
- Integration
- Programming

Programming tends to be 10-20% of overall productivity.

Over the total lifetime of a software package, over 70-90% of budget/time is spent on maintenance.
