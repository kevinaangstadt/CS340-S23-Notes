##  Lecture 17

#  3/15/2023

### Overview
This lecture focuses mainly on working with test inputs. Topics include Control flow graphs, automated test generation, 
oracle problems, path predicates, and fuzz testing.

****How do we make software work with partially implemented features?****

 - Why is this a problem we need to solve?
         - CI/CD + big feature
 - Possible Soutions:
         - Not release version (break CI/CD)
         - No way to access the feature
 - Decided upon solution:
         - Write code that doesn't break build
         - Slowly code it up with things that work
         - Hide it from user until finished

**Control flow graphs**



    def foo(a,b,c,d,e,f):
    if a < b:
            This
        else:
                That
        if c < d:
                Ed
        else:
                Lisa
        if e < f:
                CS
        else:
                DS

 - 6 branches
 - 2 tests needed for branch coverage
         - foo(1,2,3,4,5,6)
         - foo(6,5,4,3,2,1)
 - Path coverage is more strict than branch coverage, If thre are n sequential (serial) if statements:
         - 2n branch edges
    -  2 tests to cover branches
    -  2^n tests to cover paths
***
**Automated test generation to increase our coverage**

 - How do we check this output?
 >#### Oracle problem
>Difficulty and cost of determining the correct output and input
>
>### Implicit oracle
>don’t crash, terminate in n minues, don’t leak secrets

2 approaches - Think really hard and write down the tests or try random things and see what paths are covered

Thinking hard:
>### Path predicate
>A path predicate (path condition or path constraint) is a boolean formula over program variables that is true when the program executes a given path
>-   Ex: lets say we want the path False False True
>a >= b and c >=d and e < f
>We could assign the values:
    2, 1, 3, 2, 3, 4

Try random things and see what happens:
-   Directed automated random testing (DART)
        - Ex: Wolfram Mathematica
-   Fuzz testing - mutate a given input and see what happens

 **Fuzz Testing coding example**

    #example of random test input generation in python
    import random
    import os
    import subprocess
    import tempfile

    def fuzzer(max_length = 100, char_start = 32, char_range = 32):

    """
    Generate a string of up to max_length characters in the range char_start, char_start +char_range
    """

    #pick a string length
    string_length = random.randrange(1, max_length + 1)

    out = ""
    for i in range(string_length):
        #pick a random character and add it to the string
        out += chr(random.randrange(char_start, char_range   +
                                    char_start))
    return out

    #only executes if we run this python file
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        basename = "input.txt"
        #make and return a temp directory
        tempdir = tempfile.mkdtemp()
        #combine the directory and the basename

        FILE = os.path.join(tempdir, basename)
        print(FILE)

        runs = []

        #open file and write to it
        #with syntax will automatically save and close
        for i in range(1000):
            with open(FILE, "w") as f:
                data = fuzzer()
                f.wrtie(data)

        #run bc on this file
        result = subprocess.run(["bc", FILE],
                stdin = subprocess.DEVNULL,
                stdout = subprocess.PIPE,
                stderr = subprocess.PIPE,
                universal_newlines = True
                )
        #result holds info about this run of the program
        runs.append(data,result)

        #delete this file and tempdir
        os.remove(FILE)
        os.remove(tempdir)
         #analyze data
        #list comp
        correct_runs = [(data, result) for (data, result) in runs
                        if result.stderr == ""]
        print("correct_runs:", len(correct_runs))

        for (data,results) in correct_runs:
            print(data, ":", results.stdout)
        crashes = [(data,result) for (data,result) in runs
                    if result.returncode != 0]
        print("crashes :", len(crashes))
